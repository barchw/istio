## Breaking Changes in Istio upstream

- Istio no longer creates `IstioOperator/installed-state` CustomResource after installation. See the upstream [Istio Issue](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/44814) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/47860) for more information.
- Discontinue support for `Referer` headers containing user info or fragment components. The new sanitization behaviour is described [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.26.7/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-referer).
