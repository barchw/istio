## New Features

- Allow for opting out of the **ENABLE_EXTERNAL_NAME_ALIAS** Istio pilot environment variable in the Istio custom resource. This allows for retaining behavior that was present in Istio prior to version 1.21. See issue [#787](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/787 ).
- Update the Istio version to 1.21.2 [#802](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/802). Read [Istio 1.21.2 Release Announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21.2/) and [Change Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/change-notes/) for more details.
- Change Istio ingress-gateway's scaling to be based on CPU utilization only. This ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as ingress-gateway memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.
- Adjust the default number of ingress-gateway replicas on smaller clusters to 1.
- Add Request Authentication UI for Kyma dashboard [#816](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/816)
