# Istio v1alpha1 proposal

## Summary 

This document proposes  istio-manager API exposed to users. Initial version covers hpa and resources configuration for Istio components such as istiod and ingress gateway. This version also covers configuration needed to forward client information to workloads (client address via xff).

## Details

API specification on root level was split into `components` and `config`. `components` holds subset of [k8s component specyfication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.operator.v1alpha1/#KubernetesResourcesSpec) for `pilot` and `ingressGateway` Istio components. For this moment it's `hpaSpec`, `strategy` and `resources`. `config` holds `profiles` configuration, support for xff, gardener DNS names configuration, tracing and DNS proxying. 

Status will be implemented per `kyma-operator` requirements.

| **spec.components.proxy** | Proxy defines component configuration for Istio proxy sidecar |
| **spec.components.proxy.k8s** | ProxyK8sConfig is a subset of https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.operator.v1alpha1/#KubernetesResourcesSpec |
| **spec.components.proxy.k8s.resources** | Resources define Kubernetes resources configuration: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ |

| **spec.components.proxy.k8s.resources.limits.cpu** |  |

| **spec.config** | Config is the configuration for the Istio installation. |
| **spec.config.numTrustedProxies** | Defines the number of trusted proxies deployed in front of the Istio gateway proxy. |
| **status.conditions** | Conditions associated with IstioStatus. |
| **status.conditions.lastTransitionTime** | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. |
| **status.conditions.message** | message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string. |
| **status.conditions.observedGeneration** | observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance. |
| **status.conditions.reason** | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty. |
| **status.conditions.status** | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. |
| **status.conditions.type** | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt) |
| **status.state** | State signifies current state of CustomObject. Value can be one of ("Ready", "Processing", "Error", "Deleting"). |<!-- TABLE-END -->

## Future plans

Proposal does not cover resource settings for sidecars. This configuration is applied via IstioOperator CR but Istio does not support restarting sidecars. It is still under consideration wheater `istio-manager` should be responsible for managing sidecars.
