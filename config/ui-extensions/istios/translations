  inputInfo.config.authorizers.port: Specifies the port of the service.
  config.authorizers.headers.inCheck.include: Forward To Authorization Request
  inputInfo.config.authorizers.headers.inCheck.include: List of client request headers that should be included in the authorization request sent to the authorization service.
  config.authorizers.headers.inCheck.add: Add To Authorization Request
  inputInfo.config.authorizers.headers.inCheck.add: Set of additional fixed headers that should be included in the authorization request sent to the authorization service.
  config.authorizers.headers.toUpstream.onAllow: Forward To Upstream
  inputInfo.config.authorizers.headers.toUpstream.onAllow: List of headers from the authorization service that should be added or overridden in the original request and forwarded to the upstream when the authorization check result is allowed (HTTP code 200).
